### **1. Title: McKee's Character and Conflict Model**

#### **1.1. Definition**

McKee's Character and Conflict Model emphasizes that **character** and **conflict** are the driving forces of storytelling. According to McKee, without compelling characters and meaningful conflicts, a story lacks the emotional and psychological depth necessary to engage audiences. This model provides a framework for writers to develop multi-dimensional characters and layered conflicts, ensuring that narratives are both emotionally resonant and intellectually stimulating.
