```mermaid
flowchart TD
    AK[**Internal Focalization**] --> AL[Subjective Experience]
    AK --> AM[Limited Perspective]
    AK --> AN[Emotional Intensity]
```

- **Characteristics**
  - **Subjective Experience**: Provides an intimate view of the character’s inner thoughts, emotions, and perceptions, allowing readers to connect deeply with them.
