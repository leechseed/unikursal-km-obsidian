# PKM Design Principles

## Core Tenets
- **No orphaned notes** — everything links or dies.
- **Portals before chaos** — curate entry points for every system.
- **Metadata is everything** — frontmatter defines clarity and reuse.
- **Capture to concept** — Inbox → Theory or Project, always.
- **Systems should scale** — your PKM is an OS, not a diary.
